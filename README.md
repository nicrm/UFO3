1. Formulate a hypothesis/problem statement about behavior of ping times of these three servers:
  The reason some of the ping times are longer than others is most likely due to the range from where we ping them from are, so the farther
	away the the server we ping is, the longer it will take.

2. Plan an experiment, which measures response times of these three servers:
	I will ping each server 10 times to see if there are any discrepancies or outliers when we ping it.
	For 128.199.144.199 the average time it took was 208ms, while the maximum was 224ms and the minimum was 195ms.
	
	For 167.99.51.33 the average time it took was 97ms, while the maximum was 110ms and the minimum was 92ms.
	
	For 46.101.253.149 the average time it took was 26ms, while the maximum was 39ms and the minimum was 17ms.
